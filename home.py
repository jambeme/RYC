Every year, students scramble to ask their friends if the classes they will take are completely undoable and actual horror shows and, realistically, should never be taken. But finally, that issue is being solved for good by Rate Your Class‚Ñ¢¬©, which allows you and your peers to rate the classes you have taken in the past and see data from other student ratings, allowing you to determine whether taking ATDS is the right decision for you (it 100% is trust me). Rate Your Class‚Ñ¢¬© takes in basic knowledge about the user, including a user‚Äôs grade and major they plan to pursue in college, and then allows the user to provide ratings of the courses that they have taken in the past, with the options of courses to rate being all of the courses that SAS currently offers to the student body in the 2024-2025 school year. These ratings and user data are then compiled and formatted into data that users can search thro.ugh to find which courses are best suited for them, with statistics returned showing what type of major and what grade they felt about the difficulty of the class.This information that Rate Your Class‚Ñ¢¬© is providing to the student body should hopefully allow students to make much more informed decisions about what courses to take, allowing them to manage their workloads more effectively and efficiently, removing stress (or adding if someone wants to for some reason) from their already very hectic lives and schedules.")
